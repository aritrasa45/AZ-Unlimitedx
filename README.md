<h2>Usage of it? -ðŸ¦¸</h2>

<li>In summary, this program is a simple interactive number generator that allows the user to specify a starting number and how many numbers they want to print. It provides colorful output using the colorama library and includes error handling for incorrect user inputs.</li>

<li>Overall, this code is a simple but functional number generator program. It can be used to generate a sequence of numbers for various purposes, such as testing or debug</li>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <h4>new update 21st march 24</h4>
>
<li>Now it can print certain amount of random number from the limited radiant set by user.</li>
>	
><li>major error handlings and bugs fixes
> added auto clear after 2 second if any user gives wrong input</li>
>	
> <li>added 300 secs of live countdown in the tool when the user id done with it..if the 300 secs passes then it will automaticly clear & end the terminal process</li>

<h3>Breakdown of the code -ðŸ¥Œ</h3>
<h1 align="center">
  To Make Code like Me
</h1>

<li>Import the Necessary Modules:</li>

- time module for time-related operations.
```jsx
Import time
```


 colorama module for adding colors and styling to console output.

```jsx
From colorama import Fore,Back,Style,init
```

<li> Initialize Colorama: </li>

- init() initializes the colorama module.
```jsx
init()
```

<li>Define a Function to Handle Incorrect Input: </li>

```jsx
def your_error_handler(x,y,z):
```

- input_close(x) checks if the input x is not equal to 'y' and prints error messages before exiting the program.

```jsx
def input_close(x):
	if(x!='y'):
		print("wrong input")
		time.sleep(0.2)
		print("closing...")
		time.sleep(0.2)
		exit(1)
	else:
		pass	

```


<li> Define Two Functions for Printing Numbers:</li>

- print_opreation(num, a) prints numbers from num to a-1 without delays.

```jsx
def print_opreation(num,a):
    while(num<a):
    	print(num)
    	num= num + 1	

```
- print_slow(num, a) prints numbers from num to a-1 with a 0.2-second delay between each number.

```jsx
def print_slow(num,a):
    	while(a>num):
    		print(num)
    		num= num + 1
    		time.sleep(0.2)

```
<li>Define a Function to Create a Timer: </li>

- timer(m) prints "Printing in m seconds" for m seconds, then prints "starting..." on a new line.

```jsx
def timer(m):
     	while(m>0):
     		print("Printing in",m,"seconds",end='\r')
     		time.sleep(1)
     		m = m -1
     		if(m==0):
     		     	print("\n starting....")     	

```
<li>Welcome Message and Input Validation:</li>

- Prints a welcome message and asks the user if they want to continue.
- Calls input_close(x) to handle incorrect input.

```jsx
print(Style.BRIGHT + "welcome to number generrator \n V2")
print(Style.RESET_ALL)
time.sleep(0.3)

x=input(Fore.RED + "do u want to continue? \n [y/n]")
print(Style.RESET_ALL)  
input_close(x)
time.sleep(0.5)

```

 Get Input from the User:



- Gets the start number (num) and the number of numbers to print (a) from the user.

```jsx
num=int(input("enter from which you want to start number  : "))
a=int(input("input how many numbers \n you want to print   : "))


```

<li>Check for Delay Option: </li>

```jsx
l= input("Do you need print Delays? \n [Y/n]")
```
- Asks the user if they want to add print delays.

<li> Print Numbers: </li>

- Based on the user's choice, either print_opreation() or print_slow() is called to print the numbers.

<h2 align="center">
  Without timer delay
</h2>

```jsx 
def print_opreation(num,a):
    while(num<a):
     print(num)
     num= num + 1 
```
<h2 align="center">
  With timer delay
</h2>

```jsx 
def print_slow(num,a):
     while(a>num):
      print(num)
      num= num + 1
      time.sleep(0.2)
```


<li> Thank the User: </li>

```jsx
print(Style.BRIGHT+"Thank You")
```

- Prints a thank you message.

what's the use of it?
</h1>

<li>Code Functionality:</li>

This Python code is a number generator that allows users to specify a starting number and the number of numbers they want to print. It offers two printing options:

1. Printing without delays: Prints the numbers consecutively.
2. Printing with delays: Prints the numbers with a 0.2-second delay between each number.

Use of the Code:

This code can be used for various purposes, such as:

* Generating sequential numbers: For creating lists, sequences, or other data structures.
* Testing and debugging: To verify the behavior of loops or other code that involves numerical sequences.
* Educational purposes: Demonstrating concepts such as loops and time management.
* Creating simple animations or progress bars: By printing numbers with delays, you can create visual effects.

How to Use the Code:

1. Download or copy the code into a Python file.
2. Open the file in a Python development environment (e.g., IDLE, PyCharm).
3. Run the code by pressing F5 or using the "Run" button.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the starting number, number of numbers, and whether you want to include print delays.
5. The code will generate and print the numbers accordingly.
