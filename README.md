<h3>Breakdown of the code -🥌</h3>

1. The code uses the time module for time-related functions and the colorama library for adding color to the output.

2. The input_close(x) function checks if the user input is 'y'. If it is not 'y', it prints an error message, waits for a short duration, then exits the program. If the input is 'y', it continues 

3. The print_opreation(num, a) function prints numbers starting from num up to a.

4. The code prints a welcome message with a green color using Fore.GREEN from the colorama library.

5. It asks the user if they want to continue and takes their input. If the input is not 'y', it prints an error message and exits. If it is 'y', the program continues.

6. It then asks the user for 'a" input for  starting number and 'num' input for how many number the user want to print from 'a' to 'sum'.

7. After getting the input, it asks the user if they want to continue, similar to step 5.

8. If the user input is 'y', it calls the print_opreation function to generate and print the numbers starting from the given starting number.
